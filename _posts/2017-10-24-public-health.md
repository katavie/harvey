title: How Hurricanes Affect People, Physically and Mentally

These are some notes on two papers, written by the same authors: James Schultz from the University of Miami, and Sandro Galea from Boston University. They discuss the effects of Harvey, Irma, and Maria from a public health perspective, as well as optimal recovery strategies.

## Mitigating the Mental and Physical Health Consequences of Hurricane Harvey

This paper begins by recounting the astounding statistics associated with Hurricane Harvey: In merely 5 days, the storm dumped **3 trillion gallons of water** on Texas and Louisiana, breaking the record for rainfall in the continental United States.

Hurricane Harvey directly affected **13 million people**, damaging over **100,000 homes** and causing **63 storm-related deaths**. The nature of the disaster means that a number of people are suffering from **lacerations, puncture wounds, abrasions, fractures, insect bites, and exposure to dangerously contaminated waters**. Many of those with chronic illnesses and/or cognitive impairments may be without medication and essential care. For everyone involved, there is an increased risk of developing PTSD and exhibiting symptoms of anxiety-mood disorders.

What are the community's goals for recovery? As Shultz and Galea point out, "rapidly [rebuilding] and [regaining] economic vitality and prosperity may concurrently diminish the burden of psychopathology." This perspective is multi-faceted and more beneficial in the long-term than merely focusing on "heroic" rescue operations.

A particularly interesting and important aspect the authors mentioned is focusing on "**equitable access to safe housing for poor, minority, and immigrant populations.**" The unique challenges that marginalized groups faced can easily be worsened by desperate situations. For example, "immigration policies... may have jeopardized citizens... who did not evacuate or seek shelter because of concerns about disclosing the immigration status of family members who have not yet achieved citizenship."

The article cites the Building Back Better program by the World Health Organization as an exemplary model for "**population-centric, evidence-based, and mental health-focused** postdisaster interventions." Though the effects of Hurricane Harvey were devastating, it presents an opportunity for the community and country to recover and become ever more knowledgeable and resilient.

## Preparing for the Next Harvey, Irma, or Maria — Addressing Research Gaps

From this report I learned some distinctions between the aftermaths of Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Because they all occurred close to each other in time, news and people often perceive them as similar. As this paper argues, however, that is certainly not the case.

Regarding the storms themselves, Harvey mainly caused flooding, while Irma was an intense windstorm, and Maria was a tropical storm that unleashed unprecendented damage on Dominica and Puerto Rico. It was logistically impossible for many to evacuate from Houston once the flooding began, and geographically difficult for the vast majority of Puerto Ricans to leave. On the other hand, Irma generated a mass evacuation (and accompanying spike in gas prices).

Furthermore, hospitals in Florida generally resumed regular operation not long after Irma's winds passed through, though the extensive power outages are not to be disregarded. In Texas, well-rehearsed emergency plans made the best of the flooding situation and minimized storm-related fatalities. In Puerto Rico, however, 58 of the island's 69 hospitals lacked power on September 26, an already alarming situation that only worsened as the next week passed.

What can we learn from these differences? A broad approach won't work. We require more precision to identify and address issues, because even in the same city or neighborhood, survivors' needs can vary. Regarding my own project, this is something that social media can potentially address. "The science of **connecting survivors to appropriate postdisaster services** remains in its infancy," and studying people's needs through online platforms is one avenue. For example, they can help us **measure baseline data** that are needed to define and interpret consequences.

Overall, these two articles provide a timely assessment of the mental and public health ramifications of Harvey, as well as optimistic guidance for moving forward.
