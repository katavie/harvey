These are some notes on a paper written by the James Schultz from the University of Miami and Sandro Galea from Boston University. They discuss the effects of Harvey, Irma, and Maria from a public health perspective, as well as optimal recovery strategies.

### Mitigating the Mental and Physical Health Consequences of Hurricane Harvey

This paper begins by recounting the astounding statistics associated with Hurricane Harvey: In merely 5 days, the storm dumped **3 trillion gallons of water** on Texas and Louisiana, breaking the record for rainfall in the continental United States.

Hurricane Harvey directly affected **13 million people**, damaging over **100,000 homes** and causing **63 storm-related deaths**. The nature of the disaster means that a number of people are suffering from **lacerations, puncture wounds, abrasions, fractures, insect bites, and exposure to dangerously contaminated waters**. Many of those with chronic illnesses and/or cognitive impairments may be without medication and essential care. For everyone involved, there is an increased risk of developing PTSD and exhibiting symptoms of anxiety-mood disorders.

What are the community's goals for recovery? As Shultz and Galea point out, "rapidly [rebuilding] and [regaining] economic vitality and prosperity may concurrently diminish the burden of psychopathology." This perspective is multi-faceted and more beneficial in the long-term than merely focusing on "heroic" rescue operations.

A particularly interesting and important aspect the authors mentioned is focusing on "**equitable access to safe housing for poor, minority, and immigrant populations.**" The unique challenges that marginalized groups faced can easily be worsened by desperate situations. For example, "immigration policies... may have jeopardized citizens... who did not evacuate or seek shelter because of concerns about disclosing the immigration status of family members who have not yet achieved citizenship."

The article cites the Building Back Better program by the World Health Organization as an exemplary model for "**population-centric, evidence-based, and mental health-focused** postdisaster interventions." Though the effects of Hurricane Harvey were devastating, it presents an opportunity for the community and country to recover and become ever more knowledgeable and resilient.

### A Multifaceted Problem

Reading this paper helped me realize the sheer complexity of recovering and rebuilding after a natural disaster. It's not enough to put people back in their homes. Those homes could have sustained extensive damage, including mold, collapses, and infiltration with bacteria carried by contaminated floodwaters. Coming from a place that does not flood frequently, I would never have thought of that.

Furthermore, there is inherently a socioeconomic aspect to this issue. The people who are already struggling might be hit disproprotionally badly by tragic events like these. Language barriers and low income shouldn't prevent affected families from getting a place to live after their home has been destroyed.

Public health isn't the focus of my project, but I've made an important connection to the information in this paper. Social media allows one to study both the situations of individual people and families, as well as communities as a whole. In other words, the Internet allows us to examine areas like public health and disaster management from many different perspectives.
