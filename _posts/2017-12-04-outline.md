The Intent to Participate Form has been posted! I've been slacking on this project a little lately becuase of other commitments, but there's one month before the deadline, so time to get to work!

I recently talked to my mentor, who is an English teacher at my high school and professor at a local university. I had a topic, but wanted some guidance narrowing it down to a specific direction and refining my research questions.

He pointed out how social media is being used for purposes different than their creators intended. In class, we've been discussing Thoreau and how his isolation from developing technologies of his day ties into our modern use of Internet and cell phones. Additionally, my teacher suggested including anecdotes in my paper to explain the exact roles that social media played during Hurricane Harvey.

Earlier this semester, I wrote a research paper for his class and went through a procedure of drafting a proposal, finding and taking notes on primary and secondary sources, writing an annotated bibliography, and more. While I don't intend to repeat all those steps for my INSPIRE project, the process taught me how to do research in the humanities.

It really isn't much different from that of a preparing and writing a scientific article, which I've done, but doing it for school and being guided in a straightforward manner helped me realize that I'm capable of writing a research paper, as long as I put in the work.

To prepare for writing my INSPIRE report, I've drafted a skeleton of an outline:

![Draft of my paper outline]({{'/img/outline.jpg'|prepend:site.baseurl}})

The background, which makes up the bulk of my paper, is divided into three sections, which serve to:

1. Describe Hurricane Harvey and its magnitude
2. Review research on social media use in disaster and emergency management
3. Propose directions for moving forward, identifying the integration of governmental response systems and social media as a pressing issue

One of the things I like about my project is that it combines qualitative analysis through writing and literature reviews with more quantitative analysis through social media data. As I continue, I'll use this outline to guide me, while recognizing that it's still flexible.
