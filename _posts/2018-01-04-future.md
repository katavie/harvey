## Ideas for Future Exploration

While the social media analysis in my INSPIRE project was not very extensive and did not reveal distinct categories, we know that social networks contain lots of different types of content. If emergency responders are to utilize these platforms, there needs to be a way of efficiently and quickly sorting through the noise.

If I had access to more data, perhaps annotated tweets from past natural disasters, one idea I have is to use machine learning to automatically cluster or classify posts in real-time. Here is a flowchart I have envisioned of such software:

A supervised machine learning algorithm can be trained on annotated tweets. The resulting model will then be applied to a feed of incoming data.

Some potential risks are that natural language processing, while currently a topic of intense research, may not be refined enough to classify tweets with sufficient granularity. Hopefully, combining automated elements with crowdsourced human labeling can combat this issue.

Challenges will definitely rise, but I'm excited to see what the future holds, and how it will impact natural disasters, technology, and the safety of communities.
