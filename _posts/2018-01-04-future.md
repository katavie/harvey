## Ideas for Future Exploration

While the social media analysis in my INSPIRE project was not very extensive and did not reveal distinct categories, we know that social networks contain lots of different types of content. If emergency responders are to utilize these platforms, there needs to be a way of efficiently and quickly sorting through the noise.

If I had access to more data, perhaps annotated tweets from past natural disasters, one idea I have is to use machine learning to automatically cluster or classify posts in real-time.
