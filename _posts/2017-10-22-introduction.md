## Introduction to the Project

![Workspace]({{'img/setup.png'|prepend:site.baseurl}})

Hi! As part of a project for INSPIRE, a national social sciences research competition held by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I’ll be analyzing social media content posted during recent hurricanes, particularly Hurricane Harvey. I have yet to work out the details, but I’ll share some of my ideas so far.

### Inspiration

I recently saw a [map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/30/us/houston-flood-rescue-cries-for-help.html) of Houston on *The New York Times* with heartbreaking words of Hurricane Harvey victims overlaid.

One of the visualization’s creators [explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6x8fng/thousands_cried_for_help_as_houston_flooded_oc/) on Reddit that these messages were extracted from a crowdsourced [Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1qmepB5HrFSthl1DyK7lG9slEabY&ll=29.749372349556896%2C-95.6675505611206) of homes and situations in need of rescue.

The messages and their timestamps included:

> 7:32 a.m. Need help getting out of here! Don’t think it will get any better! I have a 6 week old and a 1 year old! Running out of food and water!! On the second floor but water is rising.

> 5:20 p.m. We are on the second story first floor flooded We are both 70 years old

> 1:41 a.m. One Pregnant Mother and 4 year old with Asthma and his machine is damaged in the water

Many others and I were moved by this representation of the plight of the hurricane victims. Technology plays an undeniably pervasive role in our lives today, and though critics condemn constant use of it, it can become indispensible during times of disaster.

### Category

Twitter has become a popular source of data for social media analysis, from geographic frequency versus time visualizations (e.g. upticks in mentions of the word ‘eclipse’ as the Great American Eclipse moved across the country) to natural language processing (e.g. sentiment analysis of partisan political communities).

I aim to study Twitter content posted during recent hurricanes to answer questions, including but not limited to:

* What problems do people face during hurricanes, other natural disasters, and emergencies in general?

* How can social media help us address those needs?

* What else can we infer based on geographic position, timestamp, sentiment, and other information associated with tweets?

In broad terms, this is a social sciences project with computational methodology.

Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this work, I’m not yet sure which category I’ll choose for the MIT INSPIRE competition. As a social media analysis, it could fall into Comparative Media Studies. However, depending on what direction I take, it is also fundamentally a study of how humans interact with each other through technological media they’ve developed—so perhaps Science, Technology, & Society.

### Plan

On this blog, I’ll write notes about sources I read, as well as my findings and obstacles. As a warning, this blog isn’t a formal paper, and that fact will be reflected in the largely unedited writing style. :)

Thanks for reading!
