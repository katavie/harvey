James Shultz and Sandro Galea have also authored another paper, which I read and reviewed here. News and people often mix up Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, since they all occurred around the same time. Here, I clear up the issue.

### Preparing for the Next Harvey, Irma, or Maria — Addressing Research Gaps

From this report I learned some distinctions between the aftermaths of Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Because they all occurred close to each other in time, news and people often perceive them as similar. As this paper argues, however, that is certainly not the case, and the differences become very important when considering what to do in the aftermath.

Regarding the storms themselves, Harvey mainly caused flooding, while Irma was an intense windstorm, and Maria was a tropical storm that unleashed unprecendented damage on Dominica and Puerto Rico. It was logistically impossible for many to evacuate from Houston once the flooding began, and geographically difficult for the vast majority of Puerto Ricans to leave. On the other hand, Irma generated a mass evacuation (and accompanying spike in gas prices).

Furthermore, hospitals in Florida generally resumed regular operation not long after Irma's winds passed through, though the extensive power outages are not to be disregarded. In Texas, well-rehearsed emergency plans made the best of the flooding situation and minimized storm-related fatalities. In Puerto Rico, however, 58 of the island's 69 hospitals lacked power on September 26, an already alarming situation that only worsened as the next week passed.

### Problems to Address

What can we learn from these differences? A broad approach won't work. We require more precision to identify and address issues, because even in the same city or neighborhood, survivors' needs can vary.

Regarding my own project, this is something that social media can potentially address. "The science of **connecting survivors to appropriate postdisaster services** remains in its infancy," and studying people's needs through online platforms is one avenue. For example, they can help us **measure baseline data** that are needed to define and interpret consequences.

Overall, these two articles provide a timely assessment of the mental and public health ramifications of Harvey, as well as optimistic guidance for moving forward.
