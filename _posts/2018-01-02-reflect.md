## Reflecting on the Research Process

Throughout this project, I've read dozens of news and journal articles on Hurricane Harvey, social media research, and natural disaster management. Although my social media analyses were not very extensive and yielded few significant insights alone, I've learned a lot.

### What I've Enjoyed

I first became interested in this topic through a visualization and article by the New York Times. Its quotes, taken directly from victims of Hurricane Harvey, were absolutely heartbreaking. The safety of children, the elderly, and the ill were especially threatened as Texas and Louisiana flooded to an unprecedented extent.

When disaster occurs, however, many people are moved to generosity and sacrifice. Though I'm generally skeptical toward sensational media, I truly enjoyed and appreciated reading about the stories of citizen heroes who saved lives during this record-breaking event.

What also piqued my curiosity was the fascinating connection between communication and technology, whose vast social networks have transformed millions of lives. My interests and background lie primarily in science, but in addition to simply performing research (if you can ever use the adjective "simply" to describe research lol), I'm passionate about explaining and relating science to the public. To me, discoveries in science (including social sciences) have the power to positively affect our lives, and I would love to play a role in translating raw knowledge to application.

### What I've Learned

I originally started out with more ambitious plans for the data analysis aspect of this project. I had hoped that the tweets would form different categories/topics. Being able to automatically detect these would make it easier to parse through social media for specific information like alerts, rescue requests, and photos of damage.

Despite my relative failures in that area, I learned a tremendous amount in my background literature review. I read a variety of sources, from op-eds to Congressional reports (which I hadn't even known existed beforehand!) to public health journal articles.

The intersection of disaster management and social media technology is inherently interdisciplinary and complex. As a result, I had to consult diverse resources and weave them into a (hopefully) coherent narrative and argument. It definitely required a lot of critical thinking and considerations of how to organize the flow of my paper, but I would say this is one of the most important lessons I've learned.

The Internet inundates us with information, and being able to sort through it, pinpoint the significant details, and create something valuable is a skill that I value.
