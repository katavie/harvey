During times of crises, traditional help systems like 911 can become backlogged. Natural disasters tend to destroy the infrastructure that enables electricity, exacerbating the problem.

Users on Twitter organized their rescue requests by including the hashtags **#sosHarvey**, **#SOSHouston**, and **#helphouston** in their posts. Accounts such as **@HarveyRescue** compiled lists of people who needed help. Some people did similar things using Google Maps, which allowed emergency responders to view location and therefore assign resources to areas more efficiently.

One unique aspect of using the Internet for rescue is that information can spread to a large number of people extremely rapidly - in other words, go viral. A devastating photo of elderly nursing home residents surrounded by murky floodwaters received hundreds of thousands of retweets, and they were soon rescued.

### An Increasing Trend

Incidents like these are not unique to Harvey; they've occurred in several recent natural disasters, from Hurricane Sandy to Typhoon Morakot. In a case study of the latter, Cheng-Min Huang, a former postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins, described how Taiwanese residents used a custom Google Map to store the situations and locations of people in need of aid.

Social media is useful both on the level of individuals and in the big picture. Studying it can reveal substantial trends. In a paper I read (Kryvasheyeu, 2016), researchers found a correlation between per-capita economic damage from Hurricane Sandy and per-capita Twitter activity (normalized to account for differences in population density).

From reading these sources, I learned about the prevalence of
